Having only heard about Meetup.com, I was pleasantly surprised about the types of activities and groups that are available online. It’s wonderful meetup.com provides a platform for people with similar interest a chance to meet in real life to share their experiences and skills. As a new comer to data science field, I was happy to find a Meetup group called “San Diego Women in Data Science”. So I contacted the host and ask to join. The I’m ready for my first meeting which happened on July 16 in UCSD library. The topic for that day is “Sentiment analysis & using Twitter”

Unfortunately, two hours before the events, I got an email saying that our speaker couldn’t come because of personal reasons. At the point, I were already out and on my way there so I decided to go anyways. Most people didn’t show up but I get to meet with the host, Mya, and have conversations about her and how she got into Data Science field. She was a Mathematics professor when her daughter introduced her to Data Science, saying that she would like it. So she gave it a try and found out that she loves solving problems with Data Science so much that she is now making it her career. The conversation was insightful and helpful for me to understand the nature of Data Science work and opportunities and challenges that it can bring. 

“Sentiment analysis $ using Twitter” is rescheduled and I would love to meet with Mya again and have many other meaningful conversation with the rest of the group.
