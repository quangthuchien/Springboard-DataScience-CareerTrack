    "My friend and I want to create a new boardgame. We have a concept but were unsure which game mechanisms to use or if number of players or playtime has any effect on making people prefer it over others. Using dataset scrapped from gameboardgeek website, I aim to find out what about a game that makes it good. From where, hopefully we can make decisions on which approach we want to take for developing our game.\n",

Gameboardgeek admins try hard to make sure the database is as clean as possible, it's likely that we have to clean the data up before it is ready for analyzed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it is note worthy that these ratings are rated by people who used this website, which means there could be bias built-in. What if the people who rated games on gameboardgeek are different from people who don't in same important manner?\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, with this dataset, we don't know the number of people own the games and the number of people who actually rated it. This missing information makes it hard to accuraly compare ratings between games. For example, game A were rated 8/10 by one person who doesn't own the game but heard about it from friends. This rating misleads us to think that game A is good when in actuality the actually rating should have been a lot lower if we could get better and more data points. Similarly, game B was rated 3/10 by one person who simply just doesn't like the game graphic. In this case, we ignore game B when it could be a really good game. \n",
    "\n",
    "Morever, there are not information on people who rated these games such as gender and age. I wouldn't not be able to tell if a game is rated high among teens and low among people in there 40's. "

In this process, the number of records went from 96,693 to 8,636 which is a massively ammount of data being dropped. I'm concerned that that this new dataset might not be representatives of the whole population. However, 8,636 records is still a good amount of games to do analysis on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest wrangling problem for this set is that not all column is numeric. Information such as game mechanisms and game types are in lists, seperated by commas. A game can have multiple mechanism and multiple types. For this, I brute force it by creating creating two series. One contains all game mechanisms and the other contains all game types. Then I convert these to series into boolean column with 1's and 0's"
